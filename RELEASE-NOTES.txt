RELEASE NOTES

 The Sensor Observation Service (SOS) aggregates readings from live sensors as well as 
 sensor archives. The service provides an interface to get the pure data (encoded 
 in Observation&Measurement), information about the sensor itself (encoded in a 
 SensorML instance document), and information about the sensor mounting platform 
 (SensorML as well).
 
  Changes since last release
==================================
 
 --- New features ---
 

	* Supported operations: GetCapabilities, GetFeature, DescribeFeatureType, DescribeStoredQueries, ListStoredQueries
	* GetFeature: 
		* necessary filters are supported to simulate a SOS GetObservation request
		* temporal filter: equals and during for valueReference = om:phenomenonTime
		* spatial filter: bbox for valueReference = sams:shape, om:featureOfInterest/sams:SF_SpatialSamplingFeature/sams:shape, om:featureOfInterest/*/sams:shape
		* comparison filter: PropertyIsEqualTo for valueReference = om:procedure, om:observedProperty, om:featureOfInterest
		* typeName: om:Observation
    * DescribeFeatureType: om:Observation -> O&M 2.0 observation.xsd
